					Howdy I am a Software Engineer currently working in Plano, TX.
					I graduated from Texas A&M University in December of 2017 and started my first job in the real
					world shortly after.
					I mainly work on developing full stack web applications with React and Java but currently in the
					process exploring NodeJS.
					When I'm not working I enjoy cooking amazing food with my wife, doing a DIY project, or playing
					video games to escape reality.
